## D - Day
What do you do ? when everything you have dreamed of EVER ! starts crumbling. When the kingdom falls and your castle crumbles, when your perfected and synchronised moves are in a state of discord, when all your environment is in sheer and utter chaos. WHAT! DO YOU DO ?

This pretty much sums up my mental state for the past two weeks ever since i came out of the exam hall after giving NSEP and realising how badly i had fu**ed up. At that moment I knew whatever my chances of getting into MIT for UG were, they now all been slashed to zilch. Take with that the free entrance into IIT K. 

How this happened you may ask ? Idk, to be honest. For a guy who cleared NSEP and NSEA in 11th grade with almost no formal prep, failing todo so in 12th... seems unimaginable. But i guess the sheer pressure that my entire future depended on this exam... It gave me a brain freeze that I am afraid has probably left a permanent mark on my life.


## Some Slashed dreams and a Scrappy Week

Naturally the next week wasen't too welcoming to me. RMO scores were released and along with that the stark reminder that I failed the IOQM cutoff aswell by 1 damn mark. Add to that the groupchats and servers discussing the nsep paper and the key. 


### Monday
 I somehow made it through school and survived the Monday. Talked to a friend of mine about some another pressing problem (that will get it's own post maybe someday) that I needed to deal with before the school term ended apart from this ruckus. Stayed up a bit late that day tryna figure out where life was head. Around 2ish wrapped myself in my blanket and proceeded to cry myself to sleep (I haven't cried in over a year omg). 

### Tuesday 
Got my revision tests' papers and surprisisngly got a 30 on 35 in chem. Considering how vengeful she has been I didn't expect anything above 25 from her correction, but sure I'll take it ig. I had earlier planned to revise Coordinate Geometry completely by the end of the week and had covered some ground in st lines already so I decided to continue doing it and made some progress on my formula sheet aswell as in revising circles. I felt like shit again by nightfall definitely needed some therapy.

### Wednesday 
I had some spark in me, God knows from where it came. It came from it was just there. On second thoughts it was probably fuelled by the unexpected announcement of a school holiday owing to the supposed "torrential rains" that let up as if on cue, right after the announcement. A real true love story as one of my friends put it ðŸ˜‚. 
Anyways I covered significant ground in circles and almost finished the pyqs of amines and illustrations of circles from Cengage. The day was spretty uneventful otherwise if u ask me.

### Thursday
We had this mains mock test on full jee portions callled BrahMos that had been schedules for thursday. I thought tbh i was ready for any kinda performance. But just for some  extra prep I put leave for school cititng that I was sick and stayed home and read up on POC and Polymers from my friend's organic notes. Come 5 pm I decided since it was my first full portions test, I might aswell give it a shot. I open the paper and in the Chemistry section there are just rows and rows of questions on Coordination and Electro chemistry or so it seemed at that moment. You guessed it I PANICKED. I answered 10 ish out of the 25 questions in chemistry and with 2 hours and 45 minutes left on the clock I hurried to the math section. BIG MISTAKE. You can guess what happened because 5 minutes later I had submitted the test and was on the bed yet again on the verge of tears. Yet again had I messed up. Yet again had I crumbled under pressure. I say this cause in hindsight most of the questions weren't even that hard. Even in math if I had applied my mind I probabaly could have easily gotten a passable 30 to 40 and easily a 50 on Chem. I didn't even open the Physics section, during the paper. I suspect this was because of a subconsscious fear of messing up and partly due the events of Sunday. But from what others told me it was by far he easiest and most of them had scored well in in 80s in physics. Well after all this, I think I woke up. Consciously or subsconsciously. I made a decision. No more self pity, No more depression. I had hit Rock Bottom. Time for day's rest and then claw my wake back up.

### Friday
Spent almost the entire day watching DExter, Some may call this a day wasted. But i did some serious self-reflection and started getting myself back together. By evening yesterday I was almost back to normal. Not normal no, better than normal. Now I had learnt the importance of keeping calm under serious stress, after experiencing it first-hand. I guess i should kinda be thankful this happened now and not in the actual JEE exam, cuz that would've been hella more disasterous. 

If anything this hourney has taught me one thing

At times in life your just feel.. useless, unwanted, suicidal even. And though everyone around you may try to comfort you and bring you out back to your normal self. Deep down _**ITS YOU AND YOU ONLY**_ who can dig yourself out of that early grave. So to anyone else who is facing similar conditions. **WAKE UP AND FACE THAT DANGER.** Good Luck :) in whatever your doing.

I aim to post biweekly so hopefully will have another post by Wednesday. No promises though.
